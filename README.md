# Jump to Next Item

Displaying details for items in a list is a fundamental pattern in mobile apps. While Telegram has elegantly streamlined this with its channel navigation, I've brought a similar experience with Jetpack Compose.

This project showcases a swipe-based approach for navigating item details, eliminating the need for constant back-and-forth clicks. This enhances user flow and engagement, providing a more efficient way to explore content.
